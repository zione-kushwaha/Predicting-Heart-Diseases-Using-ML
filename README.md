## üöÄ **Project Overview**

The project follows these steps to build the model:

1. **Problem Definition**: Define the problem statement.
2. **Data Preparation**: Load and inspect the data.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the distribution of the target variable and analyze feature relationships.
4. **Modeling**: Train multiple machine learning models.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tune hyperparameters using `RandomizedSearchCV` and `GridSearchCV`.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using various metrics.
